    <h1>MY PORTFOLIO</h1>
    <p>
      Who is Edwin? Edwin is a dedicated and detail-oriented Geology graduate
      from the University of Nairobi with hands-on experience in geological
      mapping, data analysis, and fieldwork. My academic background is
      complemented by practical training in mineral exploration and data systems
      through various internships and contract roles. My strong communication
      and self drive has helped me to work effectively in teams and
      independently. I am proficient in geological software and tools, including
      GIS and data analysis software, and have a solid understanding of
      geological principles and practices. I am eager to contribute my skills
      and knowledge to a dynamic team in the mining or environmental sector.
